# Pricing Options

I am currently taking IEOR 4735: Structured and Hybrid products which is largely focused on pricing various derivatives. The class is almost entirely theory, but the professor sometimes makes little asides about various implementations. I am working on building some simple computational models to 

1) confirm my understanding of the material
2) generate my own models of various financial tools (options prices, yield curves, implied vol curves, etc)
